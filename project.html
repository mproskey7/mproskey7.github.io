		<center><h4><u> College Aspirations </u></h4></center>
	<p> In College beyond being a finance or accounting major I hope to take on roles of leadership.
	These roles could be within my fraternity or outside of it. Some roles that interest me within my fraternity are being the Risk manager
	or on pledge board. The Risk manager helps to enforce proper self control among the members of the fraternity and deals with different 
	scenarios involving risk. Outside of the fraternity, I am interested in helping out with UGA HEROS which is a 
	charity for children who have been affected by AIDS.</p>
